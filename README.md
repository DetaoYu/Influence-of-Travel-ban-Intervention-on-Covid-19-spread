# Influence-of-Travel-ban-Intervention-on-Covid-19-spread
Human mobility patterns and changes could be one indicator for understanding Cvirus. Currently, the Wisconsin government is focusing on making policy to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Our project is going to detect infected cases in each county in Wisconsin, analyze the infected cases distribution after implementation of travel ban. We will consider various factors including population density, mobility trends for places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies. Mobility trends for places like local parks, national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens. Mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations. Mobility trends for places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters. Mobility trends for places of residence and for places of work. We will use those changes to determine what the influences are of the travel ban on each county and how it will make impacts on the COVID-19 spread.
